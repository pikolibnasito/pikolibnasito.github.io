        "Interface Layout",
        "https://i.imgur.com/IDnAhj7.jpg",
       " Interface Layout-Designed to keep the focus on your artwork, Procreate s minimal interface is divided into three parts \n Painting Tools (top right) On the top right menu bar you ll find everything you need to get started. Paint, smudge, erase, create layers of artwork, and choose colors. 1 Paint Sketch, ink and paint with hundreds of smooth and versatile brushes. Organize your Brush Library, import custom brushes, or share your own unique brush creations. 2 Smudge Blend your artwork and mix colors, and use the versatile Brush Library to achieve a range of effects. 3 Erase Fix mistakes and make fine adjustments with the Eraser. Access the Brush Library to match your eraser to the style of your art. 4 Layers With the unique power of layers, you can paint overlapping objects without altering the work you've already done. Easily move, edit, recolor and delete individual elements. 5 Color Select, adjust, and harmonize the color in your creation with multiple interface options to suit your workflow. Save, import and share palettes, and drag and drop color into your art \n Sidebar (left side) The modification tools are always close at hand on the left toolbar. Adjust your brush size and opacity, and quickly access Undo, Redo, and the Modify button with your free hand while you work. 6 Brush size Drag the top slider up to increase the size of your brush tip for a thicker stroke. Drag it back down to make your brush tip smaller and achieve a thinner line. To make bigger adjustments, tap anywhere along the slider to jump to that point. To make finer adjustments, hold the slider and drag your finger sideways and, without lifting your finger, drag up or down. You ll notice that the slider now moves in smaller increments. 7 Modify button Tapping the square Modify button automatically brings up the Eyedropper, so you can instantly pick colors straight from your artwork. You can also hold the Modify button and tap anywhere to use the Eyedropper. The most powerful part of the Modify button is that it can be reprogrammed to trigger other tools. See Gesture Controls to learn more. 8 Brush opacity Drag the bottom slider up or down to increase or decrease the opacity of your brush from transparent to solid. As with the Brush size slider above, you can drag a finger sideways, then up and down, to make smaller and more accurate changes to opacity. 9 Undo / Redo arrows Tap the top arrow to Undo the last thing you did. Tap the bottom arrow to Redo it. A notification will appear at the top of the interface to let you know which action your Undo or Redo affected. You can Undo up to 250 actions. Tap and hold either arrow to rapidly Undo/Redo multiple actions"

        "Gestures",
        "https://i.imgur.com/Ep4kJVY.jpg",
        "Basic Gestures-Move around your canvas, undo/redo, clear, copy, paste, and find useful menus at your fingertips \n Touch to Paint / Smudge / Erase- Tap on the Paint, Smudge, or Erase tool, then touch your canvas to begin. While Procreate works beautifully with the Apple Pencil, you don t need it to start creating. Simply start painting on the canvas with your fingertip. -Pinch to Zoom- Zoom in and out of your artwork to move swiftly from fine details to the big picture. Place your fingers on the canvas and pinch your fingers together to zoom out. Pinch your fingers apart to zoom in.-Pinch-Twist to Rotate- Easily rotate your canvas to the angle that works for you. While pinching the canvas, twist your fingers to rotate your canvas-Quick Pinch to Fit to Screen- Quickly fit your canvas perfectly to the screen in a single movement. Quick Pinch is the same gesture as Pinch to Zoom, but performed much faster. When you quick-pinch, your canvas will pop to full size in the interface. For best results, pinch and lift your fingers from the screen at the end of the gesture. To return to the exact view you had before you quick-pinched, do the quick-pinch gesture in reverse \n Two-finger Tap to Undo- Rapidly undo one or more of your recent actions. To Undo your previous action, tap the canvas with two fingers. Your fingers can be together or apart. A notification will appear at the top of the interface to let you know which action your Undo affected. To rapidly Undo a series of actions, tap and hold two fingers on the canvas. After a moment, Procreate will start rapidly stepping back through the most recent changes you made. To stop undoing, lift your fingers off the canvas again. Procreate can Undo up to 250 actions. To adjust the length of the delay before rapid Undo begins, go to Actions > Prefs and adjust the Rapid Undo Delay slider.-Three-finger Tap to Redo- When you Undo a step too far, Redo is just a three-finger touch away. To Redo an action, tap the canvas with three fingers. Your fingers can be together or apart. As with Undo, you can rapidly Redo a series of actions by holding three fingers to the canvas"

        "Unlock the full potential of Procreate with the exceptional sensitivity, speed, and precision of Apple Pencil. -Using Apple Pencil , \n Discover a world of adaptable Brushes crafted to respond to the pressure and tilt of the Apple Pencil.-Setup- Just draw. You won t need to connect your Apple Pencil to Procreate. As soon as you ve paired it with your iPad, you can open Procreate and start drawing right away. Procreate s brushes are optimized to work natively with Apple Pencil pressure and tilt. While you can customize a wide range of brush responses to the Apple Pencil to a huge degree, you can also simply use them as-is.-Properties- The Apple Pencil registers minuscule changes in pressure and tilt. This feedback affects how Procreate brushes respond. For example, you can tie brush size to Apple Pencil pressure, so when you press down harder you get a thicker stroke. You can tie brush tilt to opacity, so you get a solid line when your brush is held upright, but that line gradually fades out as you tilt your pencil. And you can go so much further, associating scatter with tilt, color change with pressure, and even slowly morphing between two different brush textures depending on the input from the Apple Pencil. With hundreds of customizable settings, Procreate brushes and Apple Pencil can combine to create completely unique effects. Explore Brush Studio Settings to discover all the ways Apple Pencil and Procreate brushes can interact \n Double-Tap Shortcut Double-tap the side of your Apple Pencil to switch tools or invoke your favorite feature. This customizable shortcut puts your favourite function at your fingertips. Change the default shortcut in the Apple Pencil section of iOS Settings, or select an option in Procreate s Gesture Controls. In iOS Settings, the available shortcuts are: Switch Between Current Tool and Eraser (default) Switch Between Current Tool and Last Used Show Color Palette Off In Procreate Gesture Controls, the available shortcuts are: Toggle Drawing Assist Invoke Eyedropper Trigger QuickShape Invoke QuickMenu Toggle Full Screen Clear Layer Invoke Copy Paste menu To deactivate this feature, tap Off in iOS Settings"

        "https://i.imgur.com/4TlSLff.jpg",
        "Copy Paste Menu Options One handy shortcut gives you six vital options.Access all the Copy Paste actions by dragging three fingers down the canvas. 1 Cut Cut a layer or selection. A classic clipboard function that removes a selection from your document and store it on the iOS clipboard. Once Cut, you can paste it elsewhere on your canvas, onto a different Procreate canvas, or into another app. 2 Copy Copy a layer or selection. Copy works the same way as Cut, without removing the selection from the original document \n 3 Copy All Copy your entire canvas. Where Copy and Cut only affect one layer, Copy All copies the content of all visible layers as a single flattened image. 4 Duplicate Duplicate the contents of the layer or active selection into a new layer. This will Copy a layer's contents or active selection, leaving the original content in place and pasting a duplicate of the content as a new layer. 5 Cut & Paste Perform Cut and Paste as one simple shortcut. This will Cut the contents of the layer or active selection, removing the original content from its current layer and pasting it as a new layer. 6 Paste Drop your Cut or Copied image into another document or app. Once you Cut or Copy your image data, use Paste to drop it elsewhere on your current canvas. You can also Paste onto another canvas, or even into emails, chats, and other compatible apps."

        "https://i.imgur.com/gGAQ7dZ.jpg",
        "QuickMenu offers you a fully customizable radial menu so you can work your way, fast.Every part of QuickMenu is customizable, from the six radial buttons to the shortcut you use to invoke it \n Enable QuickMenu-Assign a custom shortcut to activate QuickMenu. Tap Actions > Prefs > Gesture controls > QuickMenu, and toggle any shortcut to activate QuickMenu. If you use Apple Pencil to paint, we recommend using Touch to trigger QuickMenu.-Use QuickMenu- Tap to call up QuickMenu, or touch-drag to pick the function you need at lightning speed. If you invoke QuickMenu with Touch, a one-finger tap will open the radial menu. It will remain open until you tap a button to select that option. For a faster result using Touch, try a touch-drag gesture: when you tap, leave your finger held down, drag in the direction of your desired button, and release to select it. Once you grow familiar with the location of each button in your radial QuickMenu, you can perform this touch-drag movement so quickly it becomes a simple muscle-memory flick in the right direction to trigger the option you need.-Customize QuickMenu-Set the six QuickMenu buttons to put your favorite tools at your fingertips. By default, QuickMenu offers the following options: New Layer Flip Horizontally Copy Merge Down Clear Layer Flip Vertically You can change any of these buttons to the Procreate functions you need the most. Invoke QuickMenu, and press-and-hold the button you want to change. After a moment, the Set Action menu will pop up. Scroll through the list of options and tap the one you want. Procreate will remember your custom button settings"
